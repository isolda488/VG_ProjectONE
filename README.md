Vanessa Graham Project One Webpage 

GOAL to build a 3 page website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and GIT/GitHub.  

I originally used VScode to run GIT to commit.   But towards the end of the project I ran into staging errors which prevented VScode Publishing to GitHub.  
I created a fresh local repo and committed the files again through Git Bash.   
However, the commits reflected the individual complete files not the working commits that had been lost in VSCode problem.
